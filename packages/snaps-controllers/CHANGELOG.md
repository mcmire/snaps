## [0.10.0]
### Added
- Allow specifying a version range when installing snap ([#250](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/250))
- Add more safe default endowments to snaps ([#252](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/252))

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Specify all endowments in the `SnapController` ([#252](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/252)), ([#266](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/266))
  - Previously, default endowments were specified in the execution environment. Now, default endowments are specified in the `SnapController`, and the execution environment will only add endowments specified by the execution command, except for the `wallet` API object.
- Disable caching when fetching local snaps ([#227](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/227))
  - This ensures that the `SnapController` will always fetch the latest snap manifest and source code during local development.

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Return `null` from `SnapController.getSnapState` if the snap has no state ([#203](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/203))
  - Previously it would return `undefined` in this case.
- `@metamask/controllers@^25.1.0` ([#207](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/207))

## [0.8.1]
### Added

## [0.6.2]
### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Rename endowment permission builder exports ([#171](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/171))

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** Remove the `svgIcon` property from Snap state ([#172](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/172))
  - The SVG icon content string is instead emitted with the `SnapController:snapAdded` event.

## [0.6.1]
### Changed
- No changes this release.

## [0.6.0]
### Added
- "Endowment" permissions ([#152](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/152))
- `SnapController` endowment permissions support ([#155](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/155))
- Network access endowment permission ([#154](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/154))

- **BREAKING:** Rename Snap `name` property to `id` ([#147](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/147))
- **BREAKING:** Introduce the required `permissionType` field to `PermissionController` permission specifications ([#152](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/152))
- Make `SubjectMetadataController` subject metadata `name` optional ([#151](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/151))

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** Inline snap functionality ([#148](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/148))

## [0.5.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Update restricted RPC methods per new `PermissionController` ([#143](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/143))
- **BREAKING:** Convert all TypeScript `interface` declarations to `type` equivalents ([#143](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/143))

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Update Snap initial states ([#126](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/126))

- Prevent Snaps from being started before installation is finished ([#124](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/124))
- Correctly identify breaking changes in [0.3.0] release ([#123](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/123))

## [0.3.0]
### Added
- Allow disabling and enabling Snaps ([#116](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/116))
  - Only enabled Snaps can be started.
- Start stopped Snaps that receive an RPC message ([#114](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/114))
- Add Snap max idle time ([#105](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/105))
  - A Snap that is idle for more than the max idle time will be stopped.
- Poll Snaps for their status ([#104](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/104))
  - If a Snap stops responding, it will be forced to stop.

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Enforce consistent naming for Snaps-related functionality ([#119](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/119))
- **BREAKING:** Use the `ControllerMessenger` to communicate between the `SnapController` and its execution environment service ([#100](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/100))

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Rename package to `@metamask/snaps-controllers` ([#73](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/73))

### Added
- `PluginController`: Always persist plugin `isRunning` state as `false` ([#64](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/64))
  - Plugins are not automatically running on boot, and we should never persist this state as `true`.

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** `@metamask/controllers@15.0.0` ([#66](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/66))
  - This may cause incompatibilities with other versions of the `@metamask/controllers` package.

## [0.0.7]
### Fixed
- Store plugin states in the correct place ([#48](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/48))

### Fixed
- Ensure that the plugin `isRunning` check always runs when a plugin is started ([#21](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/pull/21))

## [0.0.5]
### Added
- First semi-stable release.
